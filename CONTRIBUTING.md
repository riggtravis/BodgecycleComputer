# Contributing
So you want to become a contributor to the Bodgecycle Computer project? Oh my gosh! Come in! Sit down! Have a coffee drink of
some sort! You might not be able to tell from the names of the names of the project releases, but we love coffee around here.
As much as possible, Bodgecycle Computer users should feel welcome to be Bodgecycle Computer contributors. There are
some things that users that want to become contributors should know before they jump into the deep end.

## Code of Conduct
You absolutely must follow this project's Code of Conduct. Anyone who doesn't follow the code of conduct will not be invited to
come ride bikes. They will not be offered coffee.

## Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct is important enough that it bears repeating. You need to follow the Code of Conduct. It was set up to help
contributors be nice to eachother. In fact, it would be best if you weren't just nice to fellow contributors but also your fellow
humans in accordance with whatever ethical system you follow. Worth noting, Travis Rigg is not a relatavist and offers a human
Code of Conduct in the form of a paper of Global Ethics which is available in PDF format upon request.

## Code of Conduct
I hope you understand by now how important the Code of Conduct is around here.

## Filing Bug Reports
All of the issue tracking for the Bodgecycle Computer project is done through GitHub.

## Suggesting New Features
Create an issue on github. Make sure the name of your issue has the following format:
    [SUGGESTION] It would be the most rad if the project did this

## Setting Up Your Environment
See the installation guide in the readme.

# What Would be Good to Contribute?
Anything really. But what is most needed is bug reports. As of right now there is exactly one known bodgecycle computer. It is
currently sitting on top of dresser and not being taken out for a ride. In fact, it spends a lot of time not being taken out for
rides. In fact, it goes out on at most one ride a day, and usually not even that. It can take a long time for the process of bug
creation, bug identification, bug diagnosis, bug treatment, bug treatment testing, bug curing to happen.

It would also be super rad if you looked in the issue tracker and picked an issue you like. Please focus on software issues and
not hardware issues. The software issues are the ones that the main (only?) developer, Travis Rigg can immediately test. Hardware
issues will almost definitely get addressed after the software ones are entirely addressed.

# What is the Vision for the Project?
It is important that potential contributors know what it is that the project is trying to be. Bodgecycle Computers are meant for
people who own Arduino boards and want to build a bicycle computer on the cheap. It is nearly impossible for a Bodgecycle
Computer to compete with a storebought bicycle computer. For about \$100 you can get a bicycle computer that will do everything
you could possibly need it to do. I'm sure some crazy souls out there will likely be able to cut costs in places in order to make
an even cheaper Bodgecycle Computer, and that's good for them, but they're not the target audience. They're likely savvy enough
that if they had wanted to do such a thing, they already would have, or have done so.

# Getting in Touch
The main (only right now) developer of Bodgecycle Computer is Travis Rigg. You can reach him at rigg.travis@gmail.com. He is also
on Twitter but probably won't get back to you. Do not try to contact him on Facebook as he will get very upset and demand that
you leave him alone. If you manage to get his phone number somewhere and call him, he will get the most upset and probably call
the police. An email is definitely the best way to get in touch with Travis Rigg.

Also, please do get in touch! Travis Rigg loves talking about his soldering projects to anyone who will listen. He has a let's
split keyboard that he finished building recently that he is very proud of the solders on. He also gets really excited when
someone thinks one of his projects is neat. We're talking he goes absolutely bonkers nuts and lets everyone he knows that someone
talked to him about one of his projects.
